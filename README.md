This project applies supervised and unsupervised learning to analyze U.S. economic mobility and cancer gene expression data. Regression reveals factors influencing upward mobility, while clustering and PCA uncover patterns in tumor gene profiles. The study demonstrates how machine learning aids social policy insight and cancer classification.
